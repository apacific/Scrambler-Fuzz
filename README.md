# Scrambler-Fuzz

An analog effects circuit for electric instruments, with gain staging and voicing suitable for lead guitar. Based on the classic Scrambler by Ampeg.

### Electronics and Wiring

The parts were from a variety of sources; the transistors were new-old-stock silicon transistors found at electronics salvage retailers. Wired by hand on through-hole prototype board and housed in a Hammond enclosure.

### Enclosure and Graphics

A sheet of star stickers, together with a sheet of alphabet stickers from the Dollar Tree, were used as a mask to apply black enamel spray paint, which was then used as a mask to etch the aluminum enclosure with ferric chloride. Finished in rattle-can clearcoat in my basement.
