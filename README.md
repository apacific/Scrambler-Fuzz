### Electronics and Wiring

The components were sourced from Mouser, aside from the PCB from Aion; project is housed in a Hammond enclosure.

### Enclosure and Graphics

A sheet of star stickers, together with a sheet of alphabet stickers from the Dollar Tree, were used as a mask to apply black enamel spray paint, which was then used as a mask to etch the aluminum enclosure with ferric chloride. Finished in rattle-can clearcoat in my basement.
